## Coding Challenge -- Due Date, Thursday November 23rd, 2017

This week's coding challenge is to implement Value iteration algorithm built for the <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v1/">Taxi-v1</a> environment by OpenAI Gym library. By <a href="https://github.com/llSourcell/AI_for_Video_Games_Syllabus">Siraj Raval.</a>

The submission file is: <a href="">RL_Value_Iteration_Taxi.ipynb</a>

## Dependencies for challenge

* numpy
* (OpenAI Gym)[https://gym.openai.com/docs/]

## Environment

That's the least relevant thing but, as mentioned before, <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v1/">"Taxi"</a> environment has been chosen.

It's a simple game. At least for humans :) 

You have a Taxi. In a little "city". You also have the direction of a passenger and a destination. Of course, you have to go to the position of your passenger, pick them and go to the destination **in the shortest path**

Hope that with the image it's all clear :D
